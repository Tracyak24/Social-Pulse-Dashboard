# Power BI “Social Pulse Dashboard” Project

1. Project Overview

The “Social Pulse Dashboard” is a two-page Power BI report designed to analyze and visualize key metrics around social media engagement. It combines data from multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) to give marketers and social media managers a holistic view of content performance, audience sentiment, and engagement trends.

2. Objectives and Business Questions

  • Identify High-Performing Content: Which post types, niche categories, and platforms generate the highest engagement rates (likes, shares, comments)?
  
  • Optimize Posting Strategy: How does engagement vary by time (month, day, hour) and hashtag usage?
  
  • Understand Audience Sentiment: Are posts generally received positively, negatively, or neutrally, and how does that affect engagement?
  
  • Measure Overall Performance: What are the average shares, likes, and engagement rates across different platforms?

3. Data Preparation & Modeling

    • Data Sources: Aggregated social media metrics from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, including post details (type, hashtags, sentiment score) and performance (likes, shares,   comments).

   • Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, standardized date formats, and ensured consistent labeling for post types and platforms.

    • Data Modeling: Established relationships between core tables (posts, platforms, sentiments) to enable cross-filtering and robust visualization in Power BI.

4. Dashboard Design & Visualizations

    • Page 1 (Overview & Key Metrics):
        • KPI Cards: Display overall averages (shares, likes, engagement rate).
        • Pie Charts & Bar Charts: Break down engagement rate by post type (image, video, poll, etc.) and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
        • Bar/Column Chart: Show engagement by niche category (e.g., Food, Marketing, Travel) and platform.
        • Line Chart: Track engagement rate over time or by hour for quick trend analysis.

    • Page 2 (Deeper Insights & Time Analysis):
        • Month-by-Month Comparison: Engagement trends by month and platform.
        • Day & Hour Analysis: Engagement rate by post day, helping optimize posting times.
        • Hashtag Impact: Visualization showing engagement rates across different hashtag usage levels (0, 1, 2+).
        • Platform Breakdown: Pie chart revealing which platform dominates the engagement landscape.

5. Key Insights

    • Platform-Specific Patterns: Certain platforms may excel at specific post types (e.g., Twitter for polls, Instagram for images).
    • Hashtag Utilization: Engagement can spike when an optimal number of hashtags is used—often 1–2.
    • Sentiment Influence: Positive sentiment posts generally yield higher engagement, suggesting tone of voice is crucial.
    • Timing Strategies: Identifying peak days and hours for posting can significantly boost audience interaction.

6. Value Proposition

    • Holistic Social Media Management: Offers a single source of truth for multi-platform data, making it easier to compare performance and allocate resources.
    • Actionable Insights: Helps marketing teams refine content strategies (type, sentiment, timing) for maximum impact.
    • Efficiency & Automation: Power BI’s automatic data refresh and dynamic filters save time on manual reporting and allow real-time decision-making.

7. Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard exemplifies how data visualization can transform raw social media metrics into actionable business intelligence. By integrating multiple data sources, employing effective data modeling, and designing intuitive visuals, this project delivers clear insights that help optimize content strategies, improve engagement rates, and drive overall social media performance.
